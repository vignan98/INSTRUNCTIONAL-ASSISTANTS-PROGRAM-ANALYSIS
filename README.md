# INSTRUNCTIONAL-ASSISTANTS-PROGRAM-ANALYSIS
This data analysis project is for the Information Technology Services of Northeasternâ€™s Instructional Assistant program. Instructional assistants (IAs) are trained student technicians who will be deployed to and will work in the registrar-controlled classrooms to assist faculty with classroom technology and facilitating interactions. They will be available in the classroom to help faculty who are teaching in a classroom as well as to assist in the classroom when faculty are teaching remotely. Student employees will maintain the computers and audio visual equipment in the NUFlex classrooms across campus. In this project we will analyze the impact of this program as well the operational gaps to help the ITS stakeholders improve the efficiency and monitor the operations of this program.
